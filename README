Extracts files from .resources files.

This functionality is present in the Windows SDK tool resgen, but a bug 
causes it to crash on many files.

Can also extract resources from assemblies, as long as their resource file 
ends with .g.resources

.resources files can be extracted from assemblies using ILDasm

Requires .NET 4.0 because I used Stream.CopyTo()
